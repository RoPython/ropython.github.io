Michael Foord is a Python and Go programmer. He is working for Canonicaland he is visiting Cluj-Napoca from Northampton UK.
We invited Michael for a friendly chat. Cluj Python community is invitedto join and talk with Michael. If you have specific questions forMichael please leave comments, or email them to us (so they don't getforgotten).
If you don't have any specific questions we will be happy just seeingyou come and saying hi.
We will have beers and pizzas. The number of spots is limited. Fireplacemight be missing :)
We believe this is a great opportunity for local software developmentcommunities to meet with a Python core developer, book author and just agreat open source contributor.
