    <div itemprop="articleBody"><p>For this meet-up, the first one this year, we bring you special guests
from ComplyAdvantage (London, UK)</p>
<p>ComplyAdvantage provides anti-money laundering exposure data and
compliance technology solutions to help companies control risk and
prevent their products being used by criminals, terrorists and money
launderers.</p>
<p>Talks:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">&quot;Fighting terrorism with Django&quot;</p>
<p>Fighting terrorism in the modern world is not only about hearts and
minds, guns and violence, but also about cutting off the source of
funding that enables such criminals to conduct their activities. This
is no mean feat - the amount of money involved is significant, and
hence there is a significant incentive for those involved to find ways
and means around any systems that are designed to block them.
ComplyAdvantage is one of the few companies to offers its customers a
real-time transaction monitoring platform. We’ve built the product an
existing product on Laravel which provides the powerful, modern
framework necessary to build rules and risk based transaction
monitoring, and to proactively respond as the terrorists change their
strategy. But fighting money laundering means we need to constantly
evolve, and we will soon be starting a rewrite, based in Django
supported by the powerful mathematical and scientific libraries
offered by Python. Luke and Oliver have worked extensively with
financial firms from remittance agencies to banks and insurance
companies. They have an expert understanding of the challenges
involved, and what is necessary to develop a product that can outwit
the best minds in corruption.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">&quot;Python, Big Data and Natural Language Processing: The tools James Bond ought to be using&quot;</p>
<p>ComplyAdvantage is building the best database in the world for
politically exposed people and adverse media. To do this we need to
gather huge amounts of data and use modern technologies to solve some
difficult problems so we can detect all the criminals and terrorists
trying to do business across the world. In this talk we will discuss
the tools we use to build profiles of criminals and terrorists from
news sources. We will explore the power of ElasticSearch as an
alternative to graph databases and other useful features for text-
based systems. Finally, we'll talk about how we put everything
together, how we can merge data from different sources and what
remains to be done. This talk will give you an overview of the
cutting-edge building blocks we need to build the most exciting
product in its space today. Q eat your heart out, we make the tools
which let James Bond get out of the office at 5 o'clock sharp and
drink more martinis.</p>

<p>Speakers:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Luke Mawbey</strong> studied computational mathematics and electrical
engineering at the University of Melbourne before working on 4G/LTE
research and development for Analog Devices and NEC, both in Australia
and Japan. After a 4-year stint working for the United Nations in
Bangladesh, Senegal, Malawi, Kenya, and Lesotho on data and
information management, he managed his own start-up to provide
quantitative based news analysis which allowed humanitarian
organisations to make real-time evidence-based decisions. Luke joined
ComplyAdvantage in 2015 primarily on the basis that Romania was one of
the few countries he'd neither worked in nor visited, and fighting
financial crime with big data sounded like a superhero job and a fun
thing to do. Luke manages end-to-end tech projects for ComplyAdvantage
and is also the local Hadoop specialist in his spare time.</li>
<li><strong>Oliver Butterfield</strong> graduated from Durham University in 2004 and
joined fledgling server hosting company Gyron Internet where he was
instrumental in establishing their first self-managed datacentre in
2009. Following time spent travelling in Africa, he made the move into
consultancy. Oliver met Charlie Delingpole (founder of
ComplyAdvantage) in early 2014, and Charlie's plans for the as-yet-
unnamed anti-money laundering platform coupled with his successful
track record in start-ups made the opportunity too hard to refuse.
Soon after Oliver became Employee Number 1. Today Oliver lives with
his wife and two daughters, and heads up ComplyAdvantage's platform
team. He coordinates delivery of the transaction monitoring and
screening platforms built on Laravel via a restful API as well as web
applications that utilise VueJS and AngularJS.</li>
<li><strong>Chris Leow</strong> graduated from Cambridge with a Mathematics degree, and
cut his teeth as a software developer architecting robust and scalable
solutions to business problems for media companies in London. Inspired
to take on new challenges and expand his horizons, he co-founded a
start-up in mobile geo-located media and social media. Chris joined
ComplyAdvantage in 2014 and heads the data team, responsible for
building the best database of sanctions, politically exposed people
and adverse media mentions in the world.</li>
<li><strong>Dr. Thiago Galery</strong> has a PhD in linguistics at University College
London on the relationships between linguistic structure and
contextual information. During that time, he worked with sentiment
analysis for IBM. After graduating, Thiago worked at a number of
start-ups in the UK, on topics including semantic recommendation, text
classification, news tracking, and unsupervised semantic modelling. He
was a tutor for Google Summer of Code in 2015 and currently works on
the multi lingual NLP pipeline at Comply Advantage and is enthusiastic
about using NLP to thwart the financing of criminal activity.</li>
<li><strong>Kensuke Muraki</strong> is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine
Learning (ML) expert at ComplyAdvantage. He started his career in
Japan as a software engineer, working for developing a job
recommendation system. He came to London to pursue his master's degree
in Machine Learning at University College London, focusing on
Statistical Natural Language Processing in his dissertation. After
working in several start-ups as a machine learning engineer, he joined
ComplyAdvantage in April 2015. He currently focuses on automated data
extraction from unstructured natural language texts using NLP and ML.
He is interested in technologies such as named entity recognition,
text classification, and deep neural networks as well as applying NLP
technologies into non-English languages.</li>
